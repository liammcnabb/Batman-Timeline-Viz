# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Get Your Spider-Man Villain Timeline Running in 10 Minutes

### Step 1: Open Terminal

```bash
cd c:\Users\Dingle\Documents\spider-man-villain-timeline
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (2-3 minutes)

```bash
npm install
```

**What this does:**

- Installs axios (HTTP client)
- Installs cheerio (HTML parser)
- Installs d3 (visualization library)
- Installs TypeScript and development tools

### Step 3: Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

**What this does:**

- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Validates all code types
- Creates `dist/` directory with compiled files

### Step 4: Run the Complete Pipeline (5-10 minutes)

The **easiest way** to run everything is with one command:

```bash
# Quick test: scrape, process, merge, and publish 5 issues
npm run pipeline -- --series "Untold Tales of Spider-Man Vol 1" --issues 1-5

# Or use underscore format (both work thanks to SeriesName utility!)
npm run pipeline -- --series "Untold_Tales_of_Spider-Man_Vol_1" --issues 1-5

# Or use any series with full workflow
npm run pipeline -- --series "Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1" --issues 1-20
```

**What this does:**

1. **Scrapes** raw data from Marvel Fandom
2. **Processes** raw data into villain datasets
3. **Merges** all series into combined outputs
4. **Publishes** files to `public/data/` for web serving

**Expected output:**

```
======================================================================
SPIDER-MAN VILLAIN TIMELINE - COMPLETE PIPELINE
======================================================================

📍 STEP 4: PUBLISH
📤 Publishing data files...
✓ Published 10 file(s)

======================================================================
✅ PIPELINE COMPLETE!
======================================================================
```

### Step 5: Start the Web Server (10 seconds)

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:8000**

You should see:

- 📊 Statistics panel (total villains, most frequent, etc.)

# Scrape, process, merge, and publish in one command
npm run pipeline -- --series "Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1" --issues 1-50
```

### Run Individual Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Scrape raw data
npm run scrape -- --series "Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1" --issues 1-20

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Command not found: npm

**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### Pipeline freezes at a specific issue

- This is typically a network timeout
- Stop the process (Ctrl+C)
- Check your internet connection
- Try running individual commands instead

### npm install fails

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -r node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Scraper can't connect to Marvel Fandom

- Check your internet connection
- Check if marvel.fandom.com is accessible
- Try again (might be temporary)

### Visualization not loading

- Did the pipeline complete without errors?
- Does `data/villains.json` exist?
- Run `npm run serve` and check browser console (F12)
- Try clearing cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### Port 8000 already in use

```bash
# Use a different port
npm run serve -- --port 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```
